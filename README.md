"#DevSurveyProjectFA2018"

This is a project a worked on when I was first experiementing with data science as a sophomore in college. I utilized the survey data provided by stackoverflow for their 2018 survey. The data used as well as data from other years can be accessed at https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey. During the course of this project I looked at various factors including gender,developer type, job satisfaction and salary. I also did some analysis of the data scienstist subgroup

Here are some interesting results I found:

-Woman on average made 7,000 USD less than men.
-The people who reported being extremely dissatisfied and extremely satisfied with their job possessed the higher salaries.
-Of the engineering job positions dev ops specialists made the most and data scientists and machine leanring specialist (one category) made the second most.
- There was a modest correalation between job satisfaction and education with PhD's reporting the hgihest level of satifaction.
- Developers who utilized Assembly and PHP were paid the least.
